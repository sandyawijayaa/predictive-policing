**Project title:** Decoding Safety: Investigating the Role of Predictive Policing in Crime Prevention Across New York City

In recent history, predictive policing practices have become more pervasive. Predictive policing is often characterized as a process in which police authorities analyze data trends about crimes in efforts to identify and prepare for future crimes (National Institute of Justice, 2019). Several urban cities throughout the U.S. have adopted such practices, hoping to minimize the prevalence of crime. Predictive policing practices have had varying degrees of success. There have been instances of police forces hyper-patrolling areas for no apparent reason, spreading paranoia amongst the general population and antagonizing various communities or individuals. Due to these effects and controversies, through our project, we hope to explore the effect of predictive policing on crime severity and characteristics about those crimes.

### Research questions and methods
1. Does predictive policing have a significant impact on crime severity (violations, misdemeanors, and felonies)?
- Using **Causal inference** techniques such as outcome regression and inverse propensity weighting

2. Is there a significant association between predictive policing and reported crimes features in NYC (such as race, sex, and age of suspects and victims, types of crime, number of complaints)?
- Using **Multiple hypothesis testing** techniques such as chi-squared test, t-tests, as well as Bonferroni and B-H correction techniques.
  
### Conclusion
- Our multiple hypothesis tests indicate that while there was only one significant result in multiple hypothesis testing, suggesting a notable difference in crime report demographics, other factors such as race, sex, and age did not exhibit significant disparities.
- Our causal inference analysis found the impact of predictive policing on the level of offenses to be minimal.
- Although these are primarily applicable to NYC which is where our dataset is based, our findings represent a small glimpse of the impact of predictive policing.
- Rather than use our findings as evidence to make decisions in the real world, our findings should be a consideration in developing a cautious approach that ensures both effectiveness and ethical considerations.
